- in the __generateCommandMap
	- get rid of all hard coded paths
	- there has to be a better way of checking for the module.GetObject().

- try catch
	- probably wise to get rid of the try catch and throw cos when something fails the really error gets masked
	however, theres probably a way to get the try to print the real exception. Need to look into that

- for both config fiels ensure that all commented out lines are not included. As
off now only the test list conforms to this
